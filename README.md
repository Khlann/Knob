# 2024设计制造knob开发板

这个项目主要是移植esp32c3 knob lvgl开发板和飞特舵机，进行联合控制
实现的效果是通过knob板上的旋钮对舵机的选择角度组合进行选择
主要功能是示教和角度控制，能够读取电流，力矩，转速，角度等信息

# Knob Panel Example

A GUI Demo designed for knob panel which has the voice playback function.

## How to use example

Please first read the [User Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/zh_CN/latest/esp32c3/esp32-c3-lcdkit/user_guide.html) of the ESP32-C3-LCDkit to learn about its software and hardware information.

The example can be directly flashed to the board by [ESP Launchpad](https://espressif.github.io/esp-launchpad/?flashConfigURL=https://dl.espressif.com/AE/esp-dev-kits/config.toml).

### ESP-IDF Required

* The ESP-IDF v5.0 or later is required to use this example. For using the branch of ESP-IDF, the latest branch `release/v5.1` is recommended. For using the tag of ESP-IDF, the tag `v5.1.2` or later is recommended.
* Please follow the [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/get-started/index.html) to set up the development environment.

### Hardware Required

* An ESP32-C3-LCDkit development board with subboard and speaker
* An USB Type-C cable for Power supply and programming

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

### GUI Control

1. In "Root" page, short press to enter "App" page and long press to restore factory settings.
2. In "App" page, short press to confirm and long press to exit.

## Troubleshooting

* Program upload failure
    * Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
    * The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate in the `menuconfig` menu, and try again.
    * Error message with `A fatal error occurred: Could not open /dev/ttyACM0, the port doesn't exist`: Please first make sure the development board connected, then make board into "Download Boot" by following steps:
        1. keep press the knob
        2. short press "REST(SW3)" button
        3. release the knob
        4. upload program and reset
* Program runtime failure
    * Error message with `i2s_common: i2s_channel_disable : the channel has not been enabled yet`: This is a normal message, please ignore it.
